12.01.25 

Implemented Redmine Feature #107 - Control number of labels on the linear Axis for categorical charts (show "MinorTicks" option, including 2nd axis) 
Implemented Redmine Feature #108 - Control number of ticks on the linear Axis for categorical charts ("DesiredTickCount", including 2nd axis with independent scale) 
Implemented Redmine Feature #109 - Rounded maximum for linear axis in categorical charts ("DomainRoundMode" option, including 2nd axis with independent scale) 
Solved Redmine Issue #120 - Axis labels get cut off 
Solved Redmine Issue #78 - Fix the vertical order in which series are drawn, so that when applicable, they show from top to bottom.
Solved Redmine Issue #121 - Tooltips in barcharts do not appear if bars overflow.
Solved Redmine Issue #103 - Ordinal axis grids not being drawn
MultiValueTranslator: issue when no categories
Solved valueFormat receives numeric value, doesn't parse
Fixed typo of property name in LegendPanel 
Add multi-series barline support
useCompositeAxis compatible with flat arrays
vml namespace conflict: revert sparkline, declaration in protovis-msie no longer lazy
align horizontal text in composite vertical axis towards the chart; revert convention breaks in multiline conditional expressions
workaround issue in 16th decimal position in IE9 64bit
Fixed regression with bulletcharts being translated in 10px down
Added new (and some of the missing) documentation to the testZZZ.html files
Fixed the drawing of bars and grid lines on the ordinal scale: they were not centered with the tick and label 
In linear axis, made minorTicks "extend" (major)ticks, so that visibility (through .visible or .strokeStyle) of the later affects the former. 
testZZZ.html files documentation mencioned '{x,y}AxisFullGrid_' instead of the correct value'{x,y}AxisGrid_'.
Fixed linear axis grid to show a line on the last tick (as opposed to the ordinal axis, that does not show the last line). When EndLine is active, it is drawn above the last grid line.
Fixed bug in the positioning of linear scale labels that revealed it self (don't know why) only on time series charts * Fixed bug in time series scale range calculation when with a second axis * Fixed bug in the drawing of minor ticks on time series scales (date arithmetic issues)
Fixed regression bug in ScatterCharts (DotChart, LineChart, StackedLineChart and StackedAreaChart) that caused null values to break line drawing. 
Fixed the visibility of the first grid line of a time series axis - it did not show because, in this case, the first tick is not on the origin.
Fixed compatibility issue between jQuery.sparkline and protovis-msie when in IE8.
heatgrid: +scalingType:'discrete' (interval-based, no color interpolation)
tipsy w/ followMouse: don't fall out of window
Heatgrid: ignore null values in min/max calculations; nullShape not taking correct index into account;
solved dangling variable reference
